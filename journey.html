									<p>Hello, I'm Robyn a recent graduate from University of California, Santa Barbara where I pursued a Communication degree, Professional Writing minor, and Technology and Management Program Certificate. I was able to graduate with a 3.97 GPA displaying my unwavering committment to my education. While I learned an abundance of skils from UCSB that I will carry with me throughout life, there is more to my journey than just school. </p>
									<p>Something important to know about me is that I originally wanted to go into hospitality for the first half of my college career. I am a social butterfly who loves chatting and building deeper connections with others, which is why I knew I would thrive in hospitality. My first two summers I worked server jobs to get the feel for the industry. I was able to develop valuable skills that I are applicable to my current career goals, such as customer conflict resolution and using feedback to provide better service and ensure repeat business. However, I discovered I wanted to have a job that utilized more of my analytical thinking as well.</p>
									<p>That is why my 3rd year I made a pivotal shift in my career path to Marketing! I immediately got involved, learning as much as possible about the industry and exploring resources avaliable to me on campus. I chose to enhance my studies by enrolling in UCSBâ€™s Technology and Management Program where I learned how real-world industries can gain competitive advantages through courses such as Marketing, Business Strategy, and Managing Tech Organizations. Additionally, I pursed a Professional Writing minor with an emphasis in Multimedia Communication, where not only was I able to further developed my writing technique, but I was also able to strengthened my advertising, editing, and multimedia design skills.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, I took up two executive board positions in on-campus organizations, Vice President of Programs for the American Marketing Association and Vice President Marketing for the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. As well as a Social Media Manager job with the UCSB Associated Students. All of these roles prepared me well for my first professional job as a Sales and Marketing Assistant at Noozhawk, a local Santa Barbara news company. Now as I wrap up my time with Noozhawk and at UCSB, I am looking forward to taking the next steps in my career where I can continue to grow and enhance my marketing skill set.</p>
