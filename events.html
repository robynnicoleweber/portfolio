										<h1>My Events</h1>
									</header>

										<p>Over the past four years, I've overseen numerous events, collaborating with both internal and external partners to ensure successful outcomes. For certain occasions, I chaired a committee of 10 individuals to organize events for my organization, comprising 200 members. Meanwhile, for other events, I delegated roles and responsibilities to all 200 members to host gatherings for over 10 other organizations on campus.</p>

                                        <h4>CASA Kickball 2023</h4>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="mu delt frat posing with theta coaches at the kickball game" /></span>For this event, I designated roles to all 200 members of my chapter, including team coaches, referees, scorekeepers, managing stations like food and water distribution, and even operating the cotton candy machine, all to guarantee the smooth execution of the event. Thirteen teams from other organizations registered to participate, resulting in roughly 500 students engaged in this philanthropic endeavor. Apart from overseeing the single elimination kickball tournament, I also orchestrated raffle baskets that members could purchase tickets for, aiming to maximize the proceeds directed towards CASA.</p>
                                            
                                        <h4>CASA Candyland 2023</h4>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="five thetas checking in attendees to event" /></span>Sold hundreds of tickets for our "CASA Candyland event," featuring a delightful assortment of candies and sweets served by our members to attendees. The event also featured activities like "Pie-a-Theta," games like basketball and spikeball, pop-up clothing shops, and opportunities to buy raffle baskets. Moreover, we organized a philanthropy week preceding the main event, which included various restaurant fundraisers. </p>
                                            
                                        <h4>Cornhole for CASA 2023</h4>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic15.jpg" alt="two girls playing cornhole" /></span> Managed the participation of more than 80 teams in our first ever single elimination cornhole tournament. In addition to the tournament, attendees could enjoy the live music and indulge in some chips, drinks, and hot dogs grilled by our members. Leading up the CASA Cornhole there was another philanthrophy week consisting of various restaurant fundraisers. </p>
                                            
                                        <h4>Bid Day 2021 and 2022</h4>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic16.jpg" alt="2 girls posing in front of a falling in love with kappa alpha theta sign" /></span>Led a committee comprised of 20 members to conceptualize and implement various aspects such as theme selection, decorations, shirt design, venue booking, catering, activities arrangement, transportation logistics, photo booth setup, music selection, and more to our event. Additionally, developed a buddy system aimed to seamlessly integrating new members with existing ones, fostering a sense of inclusion and warmth within the community for the new PC members.</p>
                                            
                                         <h4>Big Little Reveal 2021 and 2022</h4>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic17.jpg" alt="6 girls posing in matching pajamas holding up a sign that says we've been dreaming about being your big" /></span> Organized numerous "Date-A-Theta" sessions, facilitating connections between members to introduce new recruits to potential mentors who would offer them guidance throughout their college journey via our big-little program. Orchestrated a week-long series of big-little events, including activities like basket distributions, room decorations, secret messages, and more, all leading into a "Big-Little Reveal" finale where participants discovered their assigned mentor.  </p>
                                            
                                        <h4>Gauchos Go Green Blackout Challenge 2022 and 2023</h4>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic19.jpg" alt="text saying kappa alpha theta saved 34% more energy this month in front of green background" /></span>Participated in a 10-member committee to coordinate an energy conservation event across all chapter houses on-campus. The competition awarded a custom die table, hand painted by our club, to the house with the greatest reduction in energy usage from the previous month. Despite the average California resident spending $214 monthly on electrivity, Kappa Alpha Theta's bill was only $645.92 for 32 girls.</p>
